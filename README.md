Redux

Store -> hold/store the state of your app similar to how the constructor function did in react

Reducer/Reducers -> manage/update the state when an action happens. It's updating the state that is inside the store

Actions -> dispatch / run when the user does something. eg deposit money / user click a button / add a todo / make guess

    // from somewhere inside a component, click, form is submitted
